Assignment 3 Documentation

Modifications:
- The InventoryManager class was split into the InventoryManager and FileManager classes
- The 2 classes' methods were extracted into 2 abstract interfaces, InventoryOperations and FileOperations.
- These 2 interfaces were implemented and their methods overrided as needed by their respective classes.
- No methods required any significant changes from the original code; only the class splitting and interface extraction was needed.

SRP:
- InventoryManager was split into 2 classes/interfaces to separate inventory and file responsibilities.

OCP:
- Inventory and File functionality was extracted into 2 interfaces, allowing for future extension without requiring modification to the existing code.

LSP:
- The new classes can be used in place of their respective interfaces without issue.

ISP:
- The 2 interfaces created are used in their entirety by their respective classes.

DIP:
- Both classes depend on abstract interfaces and dependency injection can be used.

Notes: 
- The saveInventoryToFile method was not given any proper functionality as the original code did not have this either, so it simply prints a line for now.
- A Main class was not implemented as the original code did not have one either.
